# traceroute.org repo backend
Background:
This project is the evolution of the original static html traceroute.org website that was manually maintained. As the years go by, it became stale due to lack of time.
Many in the community were suggesting updates that were not getting applied. The goal is to allow for everyone to suggest updates that can tracked, reviewed and committed.
Hopefully this will help rekindle the original purpose: provide the community with up to date traceroute and looking glass tools that can be used by all

Please provide your suggested changes via issues or pull requests.
Please include URL, Provider name, Country of origin, Autonoumous System of origin in your requests

On behalf of the community, thank you for contributing to this project
